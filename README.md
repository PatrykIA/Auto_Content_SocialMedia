Auto Social Media Content Generator

Auto Social Media Content Generator is an automation tool that uses Make.com, OpenAI, and Canva to create and schedule social media posts for multiple platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn. This tool generates both textual and visual content and posts it automatically every two days between 17:00 and 21:00

  Features:
- Automated Text Generation: Uses the OpenAI GPT model to generate engaging social media content
- Visual Content Creation: Canva integration generates eye-catching images based on the text generated
- Multi-Platform Posting: Automatically posts to Facebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn
- Customizable Workflow: The workflow can be extended or customized using Google Sheets to manage content ideas or triggered via Google Forms/Typeform to create posts based on user input

   How It Works:
1. Content Generation: The workflow starts with OpenAI's GPT model, which generates text based on a prompt or a topic
2. Image Creation: The text is then passed to Canva, where an image is automatically generated based on pre-defined templates
3. Social Media Posting: The workflow branches into four separate modules that post the content to Facebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn

  The scenario can be modified to suit different use cases, such as:
- Google Sheets Integration: Plan and manage content in a spreadsheet
- Form Integration: Trigger the workflow with a simple sentence or topic via Google Forms or Typeform

  Use Cases:
- Social Media Managers: Automate the creation and posting of content to multiple platforms without manual intervention
- Marketing Teams: Quickly generate campaign content based on high-level ideas or inputs from a form
- Entrepreneurs: Maintain a consistent presence on social media with minimal effort

  Customization Options:
- Google Sheets: Add the ability to plan posts using Google Sheets
- Google Forms/Typeform: Allow users or team members to submit content ideas via forms, which are then expanded by AI into full posts
